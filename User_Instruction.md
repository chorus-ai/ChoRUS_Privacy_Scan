## Source data and configuration

The configuration is done via the config.py. We can modify the source data by changing the configuration file.

The tool currently supports the access to two types of source data:

                'LOCAL_TEXT_FILES': 'LOCAL_TEXT_FILES'
        }
~~~        

Where mimic is the database name and mimiciii is the data schema name
